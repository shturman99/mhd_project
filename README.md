# MHD Project: Helicity Source Term Analysis

This repository contains analysis tools for investigating the effects of helicity source terms in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).

## Project Overview

This research examines how helicity source terms and its time profile effect the evolution of magnetic and gravitational fields. The simulations are conducted using the Pencil Code, a high-order finite-difference code for solving the compressible MHD equations.

## Simulation Parameters

The primary simulations analyze the following configurations:
- `ns`: No source term (baseline)
- `rd`: ramping up and expoential decay
- `sd`: step up and exponential decay
- `nd`: step up and down
